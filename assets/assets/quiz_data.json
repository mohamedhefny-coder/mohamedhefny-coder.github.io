        "questionText": "A 72-year-old woman presents with left lower limb swelling. She first noticed her left leg was swollen about 2 weeks ago. She denies any pain and initially thought the swelling would subside on its own. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is a smoker with a 35 pack-year history and an occasional drinker. She takes chlorthalidone, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. On physical examination, her left leg appears larger than her right with 2+ pitting edema up to her knee. She also has a few distended superficial veins along the posterior aspect of her left leg. Lower extremities have 2+ pulses bilaterally. The ultrasound of her left lower thigh and leg shows an obstructing thrombosis of the distal portion of the femoral vein. Which of the following veins help to prevent this patient’s condition from happening?",
